# üöÄ PHP Project Launcher

Set a flexible Docker development environment in a second.
This package assumes that you have docker installed, and a bash compatible operating system (actually not tested on Windows). 

## Set your project services
Just once per project, in its root sources folder.

If the services are already set up for your project you can directly jump to "[Launch the services](#launch-the-services)" chapter.

### üì¶ Require the package
```sh
$ composer require mathieutu/php-project-launcher
```

*Tip: You should commit here! üòá*

### üê≥ Initialize Docker files
```sh
$ ./vendor/bin/ppl init {project-name?}
```
*Tip: You can personalize the project name, or leave empty to use the directory name. It will be used to automatically set your domaine names: `project-name.test` and `project-name.localhost` by default. To use `*.test` the developer need to edit its `hosts` or [add a dns server](https://medium.com/@narakuw/brew-install-dnsmasq-in-macos-sierra-26021c824be8), but `*.localhost` should work out of the box in unix OS*

### üìù Choose your flavour

Edit the `docker-compose.yml`, `docker/*`, and `.env` files to fit your needs.

A standard Laravel 5 / Symfony 4 application with a PostgreSQL database should work out of the box after [updating your `.env` file](#update-your-env-file).  

See the [configuration chapter](#make-the-configuration-all-yours) for all the details.

*Tip: You also should commit here üòá!*

## Launch the services
For each developer on its computer, every time s‚Äßhe need to launch the project.

### üöÄ Launch your project
```sh
$ ./vendor/bin/ppl up

```
*Tip: A container of [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) will be launched with `nginx-proxy` name if not found. It will allow you to use several domain names for your projects*

### ü§© See your project in the browser
```sh
$ ./vendor/bin/ppl open {path?}

```
*Tip: If you do it quickly after `up` command, you could see a 502 page. Hold tight and refresh after few seconds, it's just the time your server need to start!*

### üéâ Make great things

You can see all you can do with:

```bash
$ ppl --help

PHP Project launcher.

Usage:
  ppl [COMMAND] [ARGS...]
  ppl -h | --help

Commands:
  init               Install the docker files to set the services
  up | u             Run the project services (run the proxy if not already launched)
  down | d           Stop and remove the project services
  reload | rl        Down and up the project services
  artisan | a        Execute Laravel Artisan in web service (with access to DB)
  console | sf       Execute Symfony Console in web service (with access to DB)
  composer | c       Execute Composer in web service (with proper version of php)
  yarn | y           Execute Yarn in project (with Node v10, linux environment)
  bash | sh          Open a bash console in web service
  open               Open project in web browser
  logs               View output from services
  ps                 List services
  *                  Fallback on docker-compose binary
```

*Tip: By adding `./vendor/bin/` to your path, you will be able to directly type `ppl` instead of `./vendor/bin/ppl`. And it will be useful for all the composer binaries, like `phpunit`! For that, you just have to add `export PATH=‚àº/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH` to your .bashrc, or .zshrc file.*


## Make the configuration all yours

A standard Laravel/Symfony application with a PostgreSQL database should work out of the box, after having configured your `.env` file.

Uncomment the mysql example if you prefer to use it.

For now, in the original flavour, you can see the documentation pages of:

- [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/): The reverse proxy that allows you to use domain names on your projects.
- [richarvey/nginx-php-fpm](https://hub.docker.com/r/richarvey/nginx-php-fpm/): The image used to serve the web service. Directly shipped with git, nginx, php, composer, xdebug, etc.
- [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) and [mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) databases containers.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) tools.


### Update your env file

#### Laravel
```env
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
# DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=db
DB_DATABASE=local
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```
#### Symfony
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://root@db/local
# DATABASE_URL=mysql://root@db/local
```
